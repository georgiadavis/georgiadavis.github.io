      <h2>Udacity Scholarships</h2>
        <div class="pt2 pb2">
         Udacity Scholarships are not easy to find. I created a solution that communicated the mission of scholarship program and helped students find the right scholarship for them.

      <h2>Content Style Guide</h2>
        <div class="pt2 pb2">
        The content design process changed within the last year. I designed a style guide that provided visual guidelines and promoted good teaching practices for instructional videos.

      <h2>Content Management System</h2>
        <div class="pt2 pb2">
        Content developers were frustrated with the content management system. I conducted user interviews and proposed a new commenting feature.
