      Hi! I'm Georgia Davis.
      My approach to product design is influenced by my background in psychology and education.
      My experience as a teacher taught me to use empathy, research, and creativity towards solving the challenges people face.
      In my free time I love doing pilates, eating citrus fruits, and painting with watercolors.
