# Identity Management

Clever is a digital learning platform for K12 schools. Clever makes it easier for students and teachers to use thousands of learning application by providing single sign-on through the Clever portal.

While Clever provides seamless access to education applications, school districts still face the IT challenge of creating and maintaining accurate user information in identity systems. User data constantly changes and if the identity system do not remain accurate, students and teachers can lose access to their digital learning software.

Current solutions for provisioning identities are designed for organizations that have large budgets and dedicated IT teams. They require installing
software, managing servers, scripting workflows and understanding the technical details of multiple systems. To automate account provisioning, district IT teams have to go through months long sales and onboarding processes. They need to contact technical support to manage changes to their workflows and resolve major changes. 

My team set out to create an affordable and easy-to-use Google account provisioning solution for district administrators (DAs) that are overpaying for enterprise solutions or relying on manual scripts.

My role as the lead designer was to design an entirely new product called Clever IDM Essentials that focused on self-service setup and easy lifecycle management. Our goal was to enable DAs to automatically provision Google accounts without writing any code so students and teachers could have access to their learning applications. I was responsible for designing the beginning to end user experience that included product discovery, product preview, purchasing and ongoing management.

I conducted 20 user research calls with DAs to understand their main challenges with identity management and account provisioning. I mapped the core user journeys for Google account provisioning and learned that the most challenging steps were setting up email domain templates and automating organizational units.  

Through these user research calls, I developed product principles that guided my design decisions. One principle was guiding the user step-by-step by providing tips and suggestions that would dynamically appear at technically challenging steps. Another principle was to build confidence by providing previews with real user data so DAs could accurately predict the outcome of their automations.

Once Clever IDM Essentials launched, the user feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In a user call, one DA said:

"The setup wizard was very simple and I really appreciated that that that I mean i've gone through three or four different identity provider products now over the last several years and this one was by far the only one I could say that I would have comfortability with anyone with any technical level, setting up on their own, without having somebody hold their hand and walk them through it."
