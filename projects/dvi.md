# Digital Vehicle Inspection (DVI)


Kukui is a software company that serves auto repair shops.The goal of the Kukui DVI app is to allow technicians to accurately and efficiently track their work so that shop customers can make confident decisions about their vehicle repairs. As a result, auto repair shops build greater trust with their customers. I worked as the lead designer on DVI for  six months. Our team consisted of a front end engineer, back end engineer, the chief product officer, and myself.

 My role was to clarify user journeys and create consistent UX/UI patterns for the initial version of DVI. The existing app allowed technicians update repair orders, inspections, jobs, quick notes and recommendations but there wasn't a clear path for when or how technicians would make these changes.

After establishing the ideal user journey for technicians, I audited the existing design patterns and found components that were causing confusion for technicians. I developed new guidelines for typography, input controls, and informational components to improve the technician experience.

I created an ecosystem that allows technicians to quickly prioritize, update, and send reports of
their repair work by clarifying ideal user journeys and creating a library of consistent design components.
