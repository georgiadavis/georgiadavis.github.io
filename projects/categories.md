# Category Pages

GoFundMe is an online fundraising platform that enables people to receive donations in times of need. GoFundMe category pages validate that a specific cause is worth raising money on GoFundMe. Redesigning category pages was apart of a wider company effort to update all GoFundMe marketing pages.

The goal for category pages was to increase the number of campaigns started on the GoFundMe platform. I worked with the marketing team, the SEO team, the front-end engineer team, and the lead designer for  three months. I focused on category pages while the lead designer worked on the GoFundMe homepage.

My role was to design a category marketing page template that would give potential campaign organizers confidence and courage to raise money for unique causes. I addressed this challenge by first outlining the information hierarchy for all category pages.

Each category page starts with validating the potential campaign organizer's fundraising need and ends with highlighting GoFundMe’s trustworthiness and credibility. I created wireframes, went through multiple design iterations, and integrated feedback from marketing and engineering teams.

Finally, I collaborated with the design lead to finalize the category page template and maintain design system patterns that were applied across across all GoFundMe marketing pages. Check out the live version
