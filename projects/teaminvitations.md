# Team invitations


GoFundMe provides a platform for people to create fundraisers to meet a variety of financial needs. According to user research, people often hesitate to create a fundraiser because they fear the burden of managing the fundraiser alone. The goal of GoFundMe team fundraising was allow campaign organizers to share the responsibility of starting and sharing a campaign.

The scope of the team invitations feature was small but it impacted mobile web, desktop, and native platforms. I worked as the lead designer along with a product manager, native engineer lead, and two front-end engineers for  one month.

 My role was to design a simple process to invite team members on desktop, mobile web and native experiences. Campaign organizer have the option of copying an invitation link or integrating their email account to send a message through GoFundMe’s platform.

The native invitation experience had more avenues for inviting team members. Campaign organizers can send invitation links through their native messaging apps. However, the primary method of sending invitations is through GoFundMe’s platform so that campaign organizers can receive updates on the acceptance status of team members.
