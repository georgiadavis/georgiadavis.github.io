# Time Tracking

Kukui is a software company that serves auto repair shops. The time tracking feature replaces a manual time card. It enables auto technicians to clock in/out and receive performance data within the Digital Vehicle Inspection (DVI) app. I was the lead designer on this feature and worked closely with the chief product officer, a front-end engineer, and a back-end engineer for two months.

When auto technicians arrives at their auto shop they usually take their card, punch in, and begin working. Most often, auto shops do not have a digital system for tracking the repair orders a technician worked on each day. My goal was to improve the time tracking process by introducing a digital means of "flagging" repair orders. This meant that technicians clock in by selecting the repair order the will begin working on. Also, technicians can switch working to a different repair order while remaining on the clock. As a result, the time an auto technician is clocked in is always associated to a repair order. This allows shop manager to promote productivity and avoid idle time.

Since this feature affected the entire DVI application, I used wireframes to plan all the different states required for adding this feature. By introducing time tracking, I had to add an editing state, displaying a clocked in status, switching repair orders, clocking out, deleting work blocks, and viewing daily/weekly stats.

The time tracking feature enabled technicians to easily clock in and out, view their live performance data, and manage their working hours.
