# Time Tracking

Kukui is a software company that serves auto repair shops. The time tracking feature replaces manual punch card. It enables auto technicians to clock in and out and receive performance data within the Digital Vehicle Inspection (DVI) app. I was the lead designer on this feature and worked closely with the chief product officer, a front-end engineer, and a back-end engineer.

When auto technicians arrive at their auto shop they usually take their card, punch in, and begin working on a repair order. My goal was to improve the clocking in process by "flagging" repair orders. This meant that technicians were by default required to select the repair order in order to clock in. This way, the time an auto technician is clocked in is always associated to a repair order. This allows shop manager to promote productivity and avoid idle time.

Since this feature effected the entire application, I used wireframes to plan all the different states required for adding this feature. By introducing time tracking, I had to add editing work blocks, displaying a clocked in status, switching repair orders, clocking out, deleting work blocks, and viewing daily/weekly stats.

The time tracking feature enabled technicians to easily clock in and out, view their live performance data, and manage their working hours.
