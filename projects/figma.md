# Learning Figma



I built the <a href="https://learningfigma.com" target="_blank">Learning Figma</a> video course to make design accessible to everyone. I created this course because it's important to me to always to teaching the things I am passionate about. Figma makes it easy to collaborate with other designers, engineers, and product managers.

I tailored this course so that anyone can get started with Figma. I’m a big believer in learning by doing. In every lesson, students learn Figma tools through a real design project. I also teach students about the the Figma community, a place where they can learn from other designers and find inspiration.

Students start the course by learning basic tools in Figma through recreating the Figma logo. Then, they design a plant care app through building components, using autolayout and applying animations to create an interactive prototype.
