## Blueprint Design System

GoFundMe is an online fundraising platform that enables people to receive donations in times of need. The Blueprint design system was created to provide a streamlined design and development process, UI standards and documentation for future GoFundMe products.

The goal for the Blueprint design system was to improve cohesiveness on the GoFundMe platform and increase efficiency of the design and front-end development. As the lead designer, I worked alongside the entire design team and front-end engineering team over the course of one year to launch the multiple iterations of Blueprint.

Prior to introducing the Blueprint design system, there wasn't a clear process for introducing new design components or auditing existing components. This led to coexisting versions of the same component which caused inconsistent user experiences and engineering debt. There were many challenges in creating a design systems while many new projects were in flight and existing products had conflicting designs components. Eventually, I established an a process to discover,  

Develop a specific design system road map that would allow for foundational library to be built and cycles for introducing or updating patterns.
Minimize projects that get launched with inconsistencies
Use HTML/CSS devs’ time more efficiently
Engineers don’t have to guess how to put a layout together
Shared vernacular for dev and design
Dev and Design awareness on how to address new patterns on their projects
When we update a pattern, it will be updated across the product

Rather than adapting one pattern to represent campaigns across different use cases, historically we have started from scratch which means more lines of code for engineers to write and an inconsistent experience for users.
