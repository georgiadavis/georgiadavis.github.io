# Scholarship Homepage

Udacity is an online education company whose mission is to democratize education by offering Nanodegree programs that prepare students to with job-ready technology skills. The goal of Udacity scholarships is to make Nanodegree programs accessible through corporate sponsorships. I designed the scholarship homepage while the lead designer worked on designing the individual scholarship page template.

The first step of this project was to understand the target student demographic that would be interested in applying for a Udacity scholarship. Prior scholarship recipients were motivated to learn programming but not have a formal Computer Science degree nor the finances to pursue one. After understanding their motivations, I proposed the information hierarchy that would to inspire, educate, and build confidence for potential scholarship students.

I received feedback from the design team to have a story driven approach throughout the scholarship homepage. I created two different wireframes that highlighted actual scholarship student stories. Student testimonials were important for inspiring potential students to take action and apply.
