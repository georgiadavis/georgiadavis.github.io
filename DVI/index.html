        <p class="mt4 mb4">Kukui is a software company that serves auto repair shops.
          The Kukui DVI app allows technicians to accurately and efficiently track their work so that shop customers can make confident decisions about their vehicle repairs.
          As a result, auto repair shops build greater trust with their customers.

              <div>My goal was to clarify user journeys and create consistent UX/UI patterns for the inital version of DVI.
                 The existing app allowed technicians update repair orders, inspections, jobs, quick notes and recommendations but there wasn't a clear path for when or how users would make these updates.

              <div>After establishing the ideal user journey for technicians, I audited the existing design patterns and found components that were  confusing to technicians.
              I developed new guidelines for typography, input controls, and informational components to improve the user experience.
