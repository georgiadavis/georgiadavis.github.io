      <div class="center italic text-light mb4">I led the product development for a tool to write code in the browser.</div>

      <h2 class="center">Introduction</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        I developed the Code Studio in partnership with the Terminal.com engineering team.
        This product helps beginner programmers write code in the browser to reduce frustration in the early experience for Udacity Nanodegree programs.
        I worked closely with other designers to iterate on the designs as a result of data from usability tests.

      <h2 class="center">The Problem</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        Students were quitting Udacity Nanodegree Programs at extremely high rates before submitting their first project.
        There were many potential factors (such as a free 7 day trial expiration) but I wanted to explore why students were quitting.
      </div>

      <h2 class="center">The Research</h2>
        I conducted phone interviews for current students, intercept surveys from our marketing pages for prospective students, and emailing campaigns to analyzing retention and engagement data.
        Students consistently expressed frustration over different tools they needed to use and the difficulty of submitting a project.

      <h2 class="center">The Design Process</h2>
        My team participated in cross-team Google style sprint to evaluate how we we create an empowering learning environment for beginner students. We decided to execute on the idea of prototyping an IDE. We created design mocks and tested a prototype with users. Based on the positive responses to the IDE, we decided to move forward with building this tool.

      <h2 class="center">The Impact</h2>
      I ran three rounds of usability tests. The inital usability tests revealed confusion over interface.
       Users missed the submit project button, avoided using the get help button, and misunderstood the reset code button.
       These test gave us insight for iterating on the interface.</br>
      </br>
       The final implementation launched to beta testers in an A/B test. Our hypothesis was to increase project submission by 33% between the control group to experimental group to measure an effect of 18% with 90% confidence. After running the test for two weeks, our final results showed 45.3% increase of passing project submissions and a 25% total increase of all project submissions. This data proved that an in-classroom IDE could positively affect project sumbissions and retention within the beginning stages of our nanodegree.</br>
