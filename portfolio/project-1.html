      <div class="center italic text-light mb4">I led the product development for a tool to write code in the browser.</div>

      <h2 class="center">The Problem</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        Students were quitting Udacity Nanodegree Programs at extremely high rates before submitting their first project. I wanted to explore why students were quitting.
      </div>

      <h2 class="center">The Research</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        I conducted phone interviews, surveys, and emailing campaigns to analyze retention and engagement data.
        Students consistently expressed frustration over different tools they needed to use and the difficulty of submitting a project.
      </div>

      <h2 class="center">The Design Process</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        My team participated in cross-team Google style sprint to evaluate how we we create an empowering learning environment for beginner students.<br>
      </br>
        We decided to execute on the idea of prototyping an in-browser coding environment. We created design mocks and tested a prototype with users.
      </div>

      <h2 class="center">The Impact</h2>
      <div class="pt2 pb2">
        I ran three rounds of usability tests. The inital usability tests revealed confusion over interface.
        Users missed the submit project button, avoided using the get help button, and misunderstood the reset code button.
        These test gave us insight for iterating on the interface.</br>
        </br>
        The final implementation launched to beta testers in an A/B test. Our hypothesis was to increase project submission by 33% between the control group to experimental group. After running the test for two weeks, our final results showed 45.3% increase of passing project submissions and a 25% total increase of all project submissions. This data proved that an in-classroom coding environment could positively affect project sumbissions and retention within the beginning stages of our nanodegree.</br>
