      <h2 class="center">Udacity Scholarships</h2>
      Udacity has always had scholarships but they haven’t been easily accessible. There isn’t a way for students to view all of our scholarship offerings and find a scholarship that matches their needs. We had existing scholarship pages but they were one off programs that were only promoted for a short period of time. If these programs were on-going there was no way to find them. In the design process I had to think about how to migrate these pages into a scholarship hub. The main question was how we can drive the mission of the scholarships program throughout the entire hub to inspire students who were also mission driven.

      <h2 class="center">Content Style Guide</h2>
      Workflow for developing and designing content changed within the last year. There was an issue of scaling content design and maintaining consistency and best practices. I designed a style guide that provides visual guidelines and promote good teaching.
